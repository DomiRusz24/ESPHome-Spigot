# ESPHome Minecraft plugin

## Control your ESPHome server using in-game levers!

To control a specific pin, you have to place down a lever, and directly above it a sign. The sign must contain the ID of the pin we want to control on the first line.
Upon switching the lever, the pin should change its state.
